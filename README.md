# I don't know

A third party pixiv client built with Flutter. 

## It hasn't started yet.

This project is not release and still under programing. 
I prefer using less package ( exclude some native and base packages, for example database, network, webview ...) and wrting some widgets on my own.

Thanks to projects `openJMU` & `PixEz-Flutter`. Some code cames from their repository.

### Current Useful Widgets:

- ScreenFitWidth: This is implement via modifying devicePixelRation. See `screen_fit` folder for details.

- RouteAnimation: Like offical animations and hero, but i combined these two effects on my own. See 'component/transitiom_route' for more. 

- LoadMoreSliver: It is a big step forward for me, loading more with `BouncingScrollPhysics` and matains a state machine.
